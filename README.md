**SevenDB** is a **reactive database**, building on [DiceDB](https://github.com/DiceDB/dice) and extending it with a stronger foundation for **deterministic subscriptions, bucket-based sharding, and compute scalability**.

---

## Vision

SevenDB aims to be the **foundation for reactive applications at scale** ‚Äî where subscriptions are as reliable as reads and as scalable as writes. Imagine collaborative apps, trading systems, or IoT backends where every change is streamed consistently, with no hacks or bolt-ons.

We‚Äôre not just a database that can _react_ ‚Äî we‚Äôre building a database where reactivity, scalability and correctness is as fundamental as storage.

## How to get sevenDB running

SevenDB speaks the same **RESP protocol** as Redis.
That means you can connect to it with any existing Redis client (`redis-cli`, `ioredis`, `redis-py`, etc.) and use standard commands, with extra power from **reactive subscriptions**.

### 1. Run the server

Clone and build SevenDB:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sevenDatabase/SevenDB.git
cd sevendb

make build # builds ./sevendb executable
or
go run main.go #run like a normal go program
```

By default, the server listens on `localhost:7379`.

### 2. Connect with a SevenDB-cli

Best way to connect to sevenDB is through `SevenDB-cli`

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sevenDatabase/SevenDB-cli
cd SevenDB-cli
make build
./sevendb-cli  # ensure the sevendb server is running first
```

### 3. Basic operations

SevenDB supports familiar Redis-style commands:

```bash
> SET user:1 "Alice"
OK
> GET user:1
"Alice"
```

### 4. Reactive subscriptions

Unlike Redis, `subscriptions` in SevenDB are first-class operations.

```bash
> GET.WATCH user:1
Subscribed to key [user:1]
```

Now, when `user:1` changes:

```bash
> SET user:1 "Bob"
```

Your `subscription` immediately receives:

```bash
user:1 -> "Bob"
```

#### Enable the Emission Contract (feature flag)

Some advanced features, like durable outbox delivery and `EMITRECONNECT`, require the Emission Contract to be enabled.

- CLI flag:

  ```bash
  sevendb --emission-contract-enabled=true \
          --emission-notifier-poll-ms=5   # optional: tune notifier poll interval
  ```

- Config (`sevendb.yaml`):

  ```yaml
  emission-contract-enabled: true
  emission-notifier-poll-ms: 5  # optional
  ```

With this enabled, emissions are written to a raft-backed outbox and delivered deterministically by a per-bucket notifier.

### 5. Resuming after disconnect: EMITRECONNECT

### 5. Resuming after disconnect: EMITRECONNECT

If your client disconnects and later reconnects, you can resume emissions without gaps using `EMITRECONNECT`.

- Purpose: tell SevenDB the last commit index you fully processed for a given subscription, so the notifier can resume from the next index.
- Syntax: `EMITRECONNECT key sub_id last_commit_index`
- Returns:
  - `OK <next_index>` on success (resume from this next commit index)
  - `STALE_SEQUENCE` if the server has compacted past your index
  - `INVALID_SEQUENCE` if the provided index is invalid for this subscription
  - `SUBSCRIPTION_NOT_FOUND` if the subscription isn‚Äôt active for the key

Example (RESP/CLI style):

```bash
> EMITRECONNECT user:1 client123:987654321 42
OK 43
```

Notes:

- `sub_id` is the subscription identifier associated with your `GET.WATCH` (the client/fingerprint pair used by the server). If you‚Äôre using the official SevenDB client, it will surface this ID for reconnects.
- This feature is available when the Emission Contract is enabled; see the docs below for configuration and operational details.

## Metrics and Observability

SevenDB exposes lightweight emission metrics for visibility during development and ops.

- Per-shard/bucket breakdown: metrics are labeled by `bucket` (the internal shard ID) when the Emission Contract is enabled.
- Aggregate metrics are also exported for quick at-a-glance checks.

Options:

- Enable a Prometheus endpoint (off by default):

  ```bash
  sevendb \
    --emission-contract-enabled=true \
    --metrics-http-enabled=true \
    --metrics-http-addr=":9090"
  ```

  Then scrape `http://<host>:9090/metrics`. Example metric names:
  - `sevendb_emission_pending_entries{bucket="a"}`
  - `sevendb_emission_sends_per_sec{bucket="a"}`
  - `sevendb_emission_reconnects_total{bucket="a",outcome="ok|stale|invalid|not_found"}`

  Config (`sevendb.yaml`):

  ```yaml
  metrics-http-enabled: true
  metrics-http-addr: ":9090"
  ```

- Emit a compact log line every N seconds (off by default):

  ```bash
  sevendb --metrics-log-interval-sec=10
  ```

  You‚Äôll see lines like:

  ```
  level=INFO msg=emission_metrics pending=0 subs=0 sends_per_sec=0 acks_per_sec=0 lat_ms_avg=0 reconnect_ok=0 reconnect_stale=0
  ```

Notes:
- Labeling per bucket enables per-shard analysis but adds minor bookkeeping overhead.
- The `/metrics` endpoint only includes SevenDB application metrics (no Go runtime by default) to keep output small and stable.

## Why SevenDB?

Traditional databases excel at storing and querying, but they treat _reactivity_ as an afterthought. Systems bolt on triggers, changefeeds, or pub/sub layers ‚Äî often at the cost of correctness, scalability, or painful race conditions.

**SevenDB takes a different path: reactivity is core.**
We extend the excellent work of DiceDB with new primitives that make _subscriptions as fundamental as inserts and updates_.

## Core Concepts

### 1. Buckets

- Data is partitioned into **buckets**, each with its own Raft log, subscriptions, and notifier.
- A bucket is the atomic unit of replication, computation, and failover.
- Subscriptions bind to the buckets that hold their data, ensuring updates are always ordered and consistent.

### 2. Compute Sharding

- Reactive computation is heavy ‚Äî evaluating deltas and emitting them at scale.
- SevenDB spreads this load by **sharding compute across buckets**, with two modes:
  - **Hot mode**: every replica shadow-evaluates for instant failover.
  - **Cold mode**: only the notifier evaluates, others checkpoint for efficiency.
- This lets us trade failover speed vs CPU cost per bucket.

### 3. Deterministic Subscriptions

- `SUBSCRIBE` / `UNSUBSCRIBE` are **first-class operations**, logged like `INSERT` or `UPDATE`.
- Every subscription is replayable and deterministic, enforced by plan-hash checks.
- Failovers and replays always converge to the same state, eliminating divergence.

### 4. Durable Notifier Outbox

- Emissions aren‚Äôt ephemeral.
- Every computed delta is first written as an **outbox entry into the bucket log**, then sent.
- If a notifier crashes, the next one replays the outbox, guaranteeing _no lost updates_.
- Clients deduplicate using `(sub_id, emit_seq)` for ‚Äúeffective-once‚Äù delivery.

## What Makes Us Different from DiceDB

DiceDB gave us the foundation: a Redis-compatible, reactive engine with subscriptions.
SevenDB extends it with:

- **Buckets as the core sharding unit** (data + compute + subscriptions all scoped per bucket).
- **Epoch-aware sequencing (`emit_seq`)** for gap-free ordering across migrations.
- **Deterministic query plans** and plan-hash logging to prevent drift.
- **Notifier leases decoupled from Raft leadership**, avoiding leader hotspots.
- **Backpressure primitives** (ack/window modes, coalescing, priority queues).
- **Elasticity**: split hot buckets to scale out, merge cold ones to scale in.

In short: DiceDB rethought data reactivity. SevenDB rethinks _scalable, correct reactivity_.
